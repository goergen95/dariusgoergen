### What is it about?

Once the largets terminal lake in Central Asia, the Aral Sea is fed by its tributaries 
the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya. It has suffered from a significant reduction of water inflow
during the last two decades. This led to the exposure of large portions of the 
sea's surface which nowadays is called the Aralkum dessert. The diffusion of
dust and sand particles in the area may not only threaten human health and agricultural 
productivity, but it is assumed to impact the regional hydrological cycle through the
increase of aerosols in the atmosphere.

The interaction of aerosols with cloud micro-physics is very complex and one
of the mechanisms in our atmosphere we barely understand 
([Boucher et al. 2013](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_Chapter07_FINAL-1.pdf)).
In addition, our understanding of the process is subject to inaccuracies as a 
result of our limited observational capacity. For example, from passive optical 
instruments aboard satellites it is only possible to retrieve
information on aerosols when clear-sky conditions are met. Evidently, the opposite
is true for cloud parameters, rendering every analysis to significant differences 
at the time scale between the measured properties of clouds and aerosols. 
Additionally, the parameters which are derived are generalized for the vertical
atmospheric column for every spatial unit, meaning we do not get any information 
about the vertical distribution of neither aerosols nor clouds. 


### What it can do!

The mechanisms which govern the cloud-aerosol interactions mainly depend
on the type of aerosol, whether it acts hydrophilic or hydrophobic, and its size.
Some mechanisms are expected to suppress precipitation, while others are suspected
to lead to more severe and intense precipitation events. To investigate the
relationship between aerosols and precipitation, I made use of the MODIS [cloud](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/mod06.php)
and [aerosol](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/mod04.php) products as 
well as the [CHIRPS](https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps) data set.  
The former uses satellite and ground observations to retrieve rainfall rates 
at a monthly resolution. The cloud and aerosol parameters were aggregated to 
the same spatial and temporal resolution to allow some correlation analysis.

During spring (a) and winter (d) a negative relationship between the 
Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and precipitation rates (P) governs the study area.
During the other two seasons, we also see pixels with positive correlations,
however, these are not significant (pixels with a significant correlation are marked
by crosses). The analysis was done in R and included data from 2003 to 2018 because since then
both MODIS satellites delivered observations for the study area. The source code
of the complete project can be found in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/goergen95/aciASB), 
along with a more comprehensive [discussion](https://github.com/goergen95/aciASB/blob/master/docs/report_II.pdf) 
of the results.
