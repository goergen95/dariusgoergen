What is is about

This project website documents a master's seminar work at the University of 
Marburg on a fully automated, low-cost and self-build environmental sensor unit 
used in the LOEWE research project [Natur4.0](https://www.uni-marburg.de/de/fb19/natur40). 
Its core part is a Raspberry Pi 3 (Model B) equipped with sensors to measure 
incoming radiation, temperature and humidity as well as a camera and a microphone 
to take records of animals in forest environments.

What it does

The SensorBox is a fully automated sensing unit which can be used in conjunction
with a cable car mounted on specific trees to monitor environmental variables
on a vertical gradient within forest structures. There is a need to regularily 
charge the batteries on the ground station and in case of the presence of a WLAN
infrastructure the SensorBox is able to send the collected data to another station.
It can help to collect data on valuable parameters which might be used together
with remotley sensed imagery, e.g. by UAVs, to predict the spatial distribution 
of these parameters below the canopy cover.
