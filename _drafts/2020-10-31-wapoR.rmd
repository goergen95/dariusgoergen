### What is it about?

The [WaPOR](https://wapor.apps.fao.org/home/WAPOR_2/1) project is a project by FAO offering awesome remote sensing products 
concerned with water usage in agriculture on the African continent. A great
variety of different products among them net and gross biomass water productivity, 
data on evaporation, transpiration, and interception as well as biomass production
are provided at a spatial resolution ranging between 250 meters for the whole
continent to 30 meters for selected agricultural regions. 

There are already some Python packages out there that allow users to programmatically
access the WaPOR data portal such as [hkvwaporpy](https://github.com/HKV-products-services/hkvwaporpy) 
or [IHEWAwapor](https://github.com/wateraccounting/IHEWAwapor), however, I was not
able to find similar functionality for R users. So I just went on and wrote an
experimental package in R, which can be used to download raster data.

### What can it do?

To install and use the package, you should utilize `remotes` functionality.

```{r load-wapor}
if(!"wapoR" %in% installed.packages()[,1]){
  remotes::install_github("goergen95/wapoR")
}
library(wapoR)
```
From there, it is quite straightforward to query available collections. Note that
there are other collections present for which, in general, it should be possible
to download the data in the same way. But this package was primarily intended to
interact with the WaPOR collections.

```{r query-cols}
cols = wapor_collections()
cols[rev(seq(1,nrow(cols),)),c(1:2)]
```
I reversed the order of the collections vector so that you can see that there
are two available WaPOR collections representing version 1 and 2, respectively.
I would advise using the updated version 2 if you do not have other reasons
to use the first version.

We can query the available products within a collection by using `wapor_products`
together with the collection we wish to query.

```{r query-prods}
prods = wapor_products(collection = "WAPOR_2")

print(paste0("In total there are ", length(prods), " available products in the WAPOR_2 collection."))
str(prods[1])
names(prods)[1:10]
```
The total number of products is relatively high. The product names consist first of
the level a respective product belongs to. Level 1 means this product belongs to the
continental products covering the African continent at a spatial resolution of about 
250 meters. Level 2 products show a resolution of 100 meters. However, they are
only available for selected countries. Finally, level 3 data is available for only
a few specific agricultural regions, but the spatial resolution is about 30 meters. 

The second component in the product name specifies the variable. For example, 
GBWP stands for **G**ross **B**iomass **W**ater **P**roductivity or AETI for
**A**ctual **E**vapo**t**ranspiraton and **I**nterception. You can check out the
[WaPOR catalog](https://wapor.apps.fao.org/catalog/WAPOR_2/1) to see all available products, or you search through the 
product list as some metadata is also included in the above object.

The last component of a product name specifies its temporal resolution, where A stands
for annual, M for monthly, D for decadal, and S for a seasonal temporal resolution.

Let's assume we decided to download some level 3 data for the Office du Niger agricultural region.
First, let's take a look at the available products:

```{r odn-products}
names(prods)[grep("L3_ODN", names(prods))]
```
For the sake of a quick example, let's say we are interested in the actual
evapotranspiration and interception for the year 2018. We can query some additional
metadata about this product with the following command:

```{r odn-meta}
meta = wapor_metadata(collection = "WAPOR_2", product = "L3_ODN_AETI_A")
str(meta)
```
From the above, we already get a lot of useful information. For example, we see that
the product is available between 2009 and the current year and is provided in 
a projected coordinate reference system. We also can see that the unit of the pixel
values is in millimeters bit that the pixel value shall be multiplied with a scale
factor of 0.1. This is essential information, and it should be checked for all 
WaPOR products since most of them were rescaled to reduce file size. 

Maybe the most important aspect of the above output for the next step, 
is the dimensions dataframe. Here we can see that the selected product only shows
one dimension called "YEAR" which type is time. Other products
might have further dimensions, such as "SEASON" which needs different specification
in the download call.

```{r odn-download, eval = FALSE}
wapor_queryRaster(collection = "WAPOR_2",
                  product = "L3_ODN_AETI_A",
                  begin = "2018-01-01", # begin date is inclusive
                  end = "2019-01-01", # end date is exclusive
                  outdir = "assets/files/",
                  APIkey = Sys.getenv("wapor-key")) 
```
Let's take a glimpse at the data we just downloaded.

```{r odn-vis}
library(raster)
file = list.files("../assets/files/", "L3_ODN", full.names = T)
r = raster(file) * 0.1
plot(r)
```

We very quickly downloaded some important data for an assessment of agricultural
practices in ODN. This package's download functionality can be used to 
download specific regions from Level 2 or 3 datasets by providing an sf object
of an area of interest. Additionally, complete-time series can be downloaded by
adapting the start and end date. Check out the [README](https://github.com/goergen95/wapoR) of the package for another
example to download some data and leave an issue if you face any problems using
this package.
