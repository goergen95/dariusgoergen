It has suffered from a significant reduction of water inflow\nduring the last two decades. Consequently, the water retreated from large portions of the former\nsea's surface, forming a dessert called Aralkum. The diffusion of\ndust and sand particles in the area may threaten human health and agricultural \nproductivity. Also, concerns about impacts to the regional hydrological cycle through the\nincrease of aerosols in the atmosphere have been raised.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Shrinking of the Aral Sea (Source: NASA 2020).](animation.gif)\n:::\n:::\n\n(Source: [NASA 2019](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/AralSea))\n\nThe interaction of aerosols with cloud micro-physics is very complex and one\nof the mechanisms in our atmosphere, we barely understand \n([Boucher et al. 2013](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_Chapter07_FINAL-1.pdf)).\nBesides, our understanding of the process is subject to inaccuracies due to limited observational capacity. For example, from passive optical \ninstruments aboard satellites, it is only possible to retrieve\ninformation on aerosols when clear-sky conditions are met. Evidently, the opposite\nis valid for cloud parameters, rendering every analysis to significant differences \nat the time scale between the measured properties of clouds and aerosols. \nAdditionally, the parameters which are derived are generalized for the vertical\natmospheric column for every spatial unit, meaning we do not get any information \nabout the vertical distribution of neither aerosols nor clouds. \n\n\n### What it can do!\n\nThe mechanisms which govern the cloud-aerosol interactions mainly depend\non the type of aerosol, whether it acts hydrophilic or hydrophobic, and its size.\nSome mechanisms are expected to suppress precipitation, while others are suspected\nof leading to more severe and intense precipitation events. To investigate the\nrelationship between aerosols and precipitation, I made use of the MODIS [cloud](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/mod06.php)\nand [aerosol](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/mod04.php) products as \nwell as the [CHIRPS](https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps) data set.  \nThe former uses satellite and ground observations to retrieve rainfall rates \nat a monthly resolution. The cloud and aerosol parameters were aggregated to \nthe same spatial and temporal resolution to allow a correlation analysis. \n\n---\n\n![Correlation AOD and P](cor_AOD_550_RH.png)\n\nDuring spring (a) and winter (d), a negative relationship between the \nAerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and precipitation rates (P) govern the study area.\nDuring the other two seasons, we also see pixels with positive correlations. However, these are not significant (pixels with a significant correlation are marked\nby crosses). The analysis was done in R and included data from 2003 to 2018 because since then,\nboth MODIS satellites delivered observations for the study area. The source code\nof the complete project can be found in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/goergen95/aciASB), \nalong with a more comprehensive [discussion](https://github.com/goergen95/aciASB/blob/master/docs/report_II.pdf) \nof the results. \n\n\n\n\n",
