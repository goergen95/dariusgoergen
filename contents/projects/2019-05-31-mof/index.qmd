### What is it about?

Forests represent the most diverse habitat for different species around the globe.
Their monitoring is one of the most crucial tasks for biodiversity management.
Traditional means of monitoring forests are cost and labor-intensive, which leads
to low revisit frequencies and small monitored areas. Additionally, the results
of data acquisitions by human agents make the results hardly reproducible. To
overcome these limitations, a LOEWE research project called [Natur4.0](https://www.uni-marburg.de/de/fb19/natur40) 
has been initiated between several German research institutes. In this project, 
I participated in a student's seminar and analyzed tree species and forest
structures employing remote sensing techniques. 

### What it can do!

In this project, I used RGB orthoimages and a point cloud derived from
Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data to train a segmentation algorithm to
distinguish between individual trees based on a Canopy Height Model. This 
technique is based on a watershed algorithm that "grows" continues segments 
around a tree's central position to delineate the total tree crown.

Once we successfully generated the tree objects, we used an object-based  classification
of the tree species. As predictors, we used several artificially created indices and filters from 
RGB images. Finally, we trained a Random Forest model to predict the tree species. Using the point cloud,
structural forest parameters, such as vegetation density, can be aggregated on
the level of individual trees and then analyzed. We see this result in the picture
above where I calculated the [_Shannon-Index_](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/vegan/versions/2.4-2/topics/diversity) 
based on the number of different tree species found in a circular 10 meters environment. Green colors show lower numbers of tree species, while
red colors indicate a relative species richness.
