### What is it about?

Supervised machine learning algorithms can help to extract useful information 
from high-dimensional datasets to benefit environmental conversation efforts.
The correct identification of tree species based on imagery collected by
low-cost UAVs and conventional cameras is undoubtedly a promising advancement in
technology which might reduce the cost of local forest monitoring.
Because the broader use of this technology only occurred very recently, structural
investigations into the benefits and the limitations of this approach are limited.
As a student's team, we set out to investigate the relationship between the
classification accuracy and different spatial resolutions of the imagery. 
Additionally, we were interested in the question of whether or not predictor variables
calculated based on multi-temporal observations throughout the growing season
enhances the classification.

### What can it do?

We established an empirical experiment to investigate the influence of spatial
resolution and mono- vs. multi-temporal predictor variables using the Random Forest
algorithm. We used 5-fold cross-validation combined with the Leave-Location-Out
approach (LLOCV) to train a total number of 9 models. These included each combination
of three different spatial resolutions (10, 15, and 25 cm) and three different
combinations of the predictor variables (mono-temporal, seasonal, and both predictor sets.)

We learned that a medium resolutions seems beneficial and that seasonal parameters 
are able to increase the classification accuracy at about 1-2 %. There were also
indications, that object-based classification has the potential to significantly
increase the overall accuracy.
