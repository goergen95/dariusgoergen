# Presentation: Geospatial data to improve targeting of agricultural projects

- Content:

  - What is geospatial data? 
    - Vector and Raster as a models of the real world
    - example of a global precipitation raster to show 
      that measurements are continuous in space
      
  - Data Archives
    - The Landsat Mission
    - The Copernicus Mission
    - CHELSA High-Res Climatologies
    - FAO's WAPOR - Agricultural Productivity
    
  - Applications:
    
    - WAPOR: Mapping water productivity to target areas with productivity below average
    - Drought: Using climatologies to identify areas that experience climatological drought
    - Desertification: Using optical satellite imagery timeseries to map desertification
    - Flooding: Using radar satellites to map inundation areas of a river system
    
    - VHR images for manual interpretation  RGB needs NDVI and other stuff  
    - segmentation of agricultural fields -> planning/state/SAM
    - crop type identification -> recognize different plants
    - irrigation/seasonality -> seasonality
    - yield estimation ->
