This project website documents a master's seminar work at the University of Marburg on an fully automated, low-cost and self-build environmental sensor unit used in the LOEWE research project [Natur4.0](https://www.uni-marburg.de/de/fb19/natur40). Its core part is a Raspberry Pi 3 (Model B) equipped with sensors to measure incoming radiation, temperature and humidity as well as a camera and a microphone to take records of animals in forest environments.
