# About me

I am anworking on a range of topics concerned with environmental change and the 
associated coping strategies of our societies. I have been studying Geography 
and Political Sciences of the MENA region at the University of Marburg, focusing 
on Remote Sensing, Climatology, and Hydrogeography. In my projects I apply my
Data Science skills to help teams to generate information for better decision making.
Currently, I am working as a research associate at the Federal Institute for Geosciences
and Resources. I also offer freelance consulting services using R and Python for
reproducible analysis of spatial data.
