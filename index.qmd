# About me

I am working on a range of topics concerned with environmental change and the associated coping strategies of our societies. I have been studying Geography and Political Sciences of the MENA region at the University of Marburg, focusing on Remote Sensing, Climatology, and Hydrogeography. Currently, I am working part-time as a freelance consultant tasked with developing reproducible GIS solutions to strategic environmental issues in the development cooperation sector.

I am passionate about using new technologies and tools to create information from data so people can understand environmental processes and act upon the insights. Mostly, I am using R as the scripting language of my choice to create geographic workflows, but I am also using Python or specific GIS command-line tools, such as SAGA, depending on the problem at hand.
