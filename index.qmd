# About me

I am working on a range of topics concerned with environmental change and the 
associated coping strategies of our societies. I have been studying Geography 
and Political Sciences of the MENA region at the University of Marburg, focusing 
on Remote Sensing, Climatology, and Hydrogeography. Mainly, I use R-spatial packages
for analysis and visualization of geospatial data. With my Data Science skills
I have helped teams in the development cooperation sector to generate information 
for better decision making. I advocate for the use of OpenSource technologies
to democratize access to both tools and data. I offer freelance consulting 
services using R and Python for reproducible analysis of spatial data.
